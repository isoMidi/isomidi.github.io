    <p class="muted">Effective date: September 18, 2025</p>

    <div class="card">
      <p><strong>StoryTime Kids – FairyLand</strong> (“the App”) is developed and operated by <strong>vEdu</strong> (“we,” “us,” or “our”). We are committed to protecting children’s privacy and complying with applicable laws and platform policies, including the App Store Kids Category requirements and COPPA where applicable.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>1) What We Collect</h2>
    <p>We designed the App to minimize data collection. We <strong>do not</strong> collect personal contact information such as a child’s name, address, phone number, or precise location. The App uses <strong>Firebase Analytics Without Ad ID Support</strong> to collect limited, anonymous information to help us improve the App:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>App usage events</strong> (e.g., app opens, screens viewed, generic interactions)</li>
      <li><strong>App instance identifiers</strong> (random, resettable identifiers created by Firebase—not advertising identifiers)</li>
      <li><strong>Diagnostics</strong> such as crash and performance data (only if the related Firebase services are enabled)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do <strong>not</strong> collect IDFA/Advertising ID, precise geolocation, health data, financial data, or other sensitive categories.</p>

    <h2>2) How We Use Data</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To operate, maintain, and improve the App’s quality, stability, and performance</li>
      <li>To understand general usage patterns (in aggregate) and enhance the user experience</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do <strong>not</strong> use data for behavioral advertising, profiling, or cross-app tracking.</p>

    <h2>3) Data Sharing & Service Providers</h2>
    <p>We may share limited, anonymous data with our service provider <strong>Google Firebase</strong> to deliver analytics and diagnostics. Data is used strictly on our behalf and according to their privacy and security practices. We do <strong>not</strong> sell personal data.</p>

    <h2>4) Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is intended for young children and is designed to comply with applicable children’s privacy laws. We do <strong>not</strong> knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided personal information to us, please contact us immediately so we can delete it.</p>

    <h2>5) Parental Rights & Controls</h2>
    <p>Parents and legal guardians may contact us to review or request deletion of any information associated with their child’s use of the App. Because we only collect anonymous analytics and diagnostics, we may not be able to identify individual users; however, we will honor requests to the extent technically feasible.</p>

    <h2>6) Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain analytics and diagnostic data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes described in this Policy, after which it is deleted or de-identified according to our and Firebase’s retention practices.</p>

    <h2>7) Security</h2>
    <p>We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and organizational measures to protect data against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, but we continually work to improve our safeguards.</p>

    <h2>8) International Transfers</h2>
    <p>Depending on your location, data may be processed in countries with privacy laws different from yours. We rely on service providers that implement appropriate safeguards consistent with applicable legal requirements.</p>

    <h2>9) No Ads & No Tracking</h2>
    <p>The App does <strong>not</strong> include personalized advertising and does <strong>not</strong> track users across apps or websites for advertising purposes. We
